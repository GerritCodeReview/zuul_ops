Unfortunately, that sort of change is one where we update the config file for the system and reload it, so it\u0027s not one that Zuul can dynamically evaluate.  We\u0027ll have to merge it first before this one will succeed.\"\n\nI read this as, Zuul normally respects the \"Depends-On\" footers, but this is a special case because we are changing the config which requires a system reload. Hence the changes need to be submitted in order.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/zuul/config/+/267314/1/zuul.d/projects.yaml#81",

      "message": "Thanks, Edwin. That means that the Depends-On was misplaced in this case, as Zuul would have no way to respect the dependency. Normally, instead, it should behave like the topic submission, right?\n\n@James if it wasn\u0027t for the Zuul restart needed, would the topic have worked as well? (assuming that we add both the topic and the Depends-On).\n\nI was thinking about the causes were we really need this in our Gerrit development lifecycle and how to automate the generation of \"Depends-On\" automatically based on the topic, or the other way around.\n\nWhen Zuul is used as a gating process, we do not need the topic because Zuul is going to submit the change anyway, so he will respect the Depends-On. For our use-case, instead, we do need the topic because we want to make sure that we merge *ONLY IF* all the dependent changes are mergeable and green.",
