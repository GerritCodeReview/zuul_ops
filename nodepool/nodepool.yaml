        # Host key checking is disabled because:

        # valuable (fewer attack vectors).
        # 2) The images we're using appear to have a key baked into
        # them which is overwritten at boot.  Because we're using the
        # internal IP, nodepool can end up connecting to the instance
        # very quickly and retrieving the original host key rather
        # than the new one (which is likely to be written a couple of
        # seconds later).  By disabling this in nodepool, we let Zuul
        # just use the first key it finds (and it's likely to take
        # long enough that it will have been updated by then).
