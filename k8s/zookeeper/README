This directory contains deployment code for Zookeeper.

The file `certs.yaml` is manually created and contains instructions
for creating TLS certs for Zookeeper.

The file `zookeeper.yaml` is the output of the Zookeeper Helm chart
with https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/23480 applied and
`values.yaml` as input.

Once that PR is merged, we can switch to using the plain upstream Helm
chart.
