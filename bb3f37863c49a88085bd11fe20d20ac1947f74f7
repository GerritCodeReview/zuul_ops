I was also thinking about a mono-repo with all the its-* plugins, WDYT?\n\nI am not maintainer of its-* plugins, but my feeling is against mono repos.\n\nThe same justification as not to make all plugins core plugins: maintenance burden.\n\nMany its-plugins are not maintained anymore its-redmine, its-rtc, others? That would mean additional burden for maintainers of currently maintained its-* plugins.\n\n\u003e All the other its-* plugins are an issue as I don\u0027t know yet how to validate them: they depend on its-base and should be built together.\n\nThe same what James did for plugin-manager: to list addtional repositories to clone?
