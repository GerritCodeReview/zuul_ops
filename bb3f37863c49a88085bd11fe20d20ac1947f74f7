      "message": "It is self-contained but it is not a proper plugin but rather a library. However, it is built and packages \"as it was\" a plugin, so the job definition is fine.\n\nAll the other its-* plugins are an issue as I don\u0027t know yet how to validate them: they depend on its-base and should be built together.\n\nAny idea?\n\nP.S. I was also thinking about a mono-repo with all the its-* plugins, WDYT?",
