# A list of checkers which should be defined in Gerrit.
#
# If the UUID of the checker does not already exist in Gerrit, it is
# created.  If it does exist, it is updated.  Fields which are not
# present in the input are not touched (nor are they considered when
# comparing the declared state to the existing state).
